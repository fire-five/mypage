I'm currently a Master student at Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. My research interests include Computer Graphics, Physically Based Simulation and Geometry Processing. I got my Bachelor's degree in computer science at SDU, and I was also an art student and a liberal arts student in my middle school, high school and freshman year.

I love art, science and their combinations. That's why I choose Computer Graphics, I believe this is the most fascinating part of computer science. 

In addition, I also like sports and other interesting things such as comics and sculptures.
